# Server_Client_Sockets
School project for introduction to system programming course.

Pseudo-online game of rock, paper scissors (and Spock and lizard), using
server/client implementation with TCP/IP Socket communication.

## How to compile and run
First initalize the server, by running the program with one argument, the port's number, on which the server is going to listen.
Then, initalize one or two instances of players by entering the following three arguments: server_ip - the IP of the listening server,
server_port - the port on which the server is listening and the username of the client. The game can be played between the
client and the server, or between two clients.

## IDE
Written and compiled in Visual Studio 2017
